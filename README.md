# 👋 Hey there, I'm Amogh!

Welcome to my digital garage of chaos, caffeine, and code. I'm a budding engineer and enthusiastic tech explorer currently plotting world domination—one bug fix at a time.

---

### 👀 What I'm interested in:
- Autonomous systems (yes, I *do* think robots should have existential crises).
- Cool hardware-software combos (Raspberry Pi is my spirit animal).
- Open-source everything.
- AI/ML... 

---

### 🌱 Currently Learning:
- Embedded Systems (I now speak fluent Arduino).
- C++
- ROS (Robot Operating System, not to be confused with Ross from Friends).
- Git (still occasionally forget to commit though 😅).

---

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On:
- Robotics projects that involve motors, logic, and probably duct tape.
- Open-source initiatives in automation or control systems.
- Anything that beeps, blinks, or moves!

### ⚡ Fun fact:
I am a State level football player...
